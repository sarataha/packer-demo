Instructions for Practice Project
========================================

## Setting up your local machine

* Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
* Install [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads.html)
* Fork this repo to your own account
* Clone the forked repo to your local machine using this command: `git clone http://github.com/<account-name>/devops-intro-project devops`, replacing `<account-name>` with your GitHub username.

## Part I: Building a box with Packer

From the packer-templates directory on your local machine:

* Run `packer build -only=virtualbox-iso application-server.json`. You may see various timeouts and errors, as shown below. If you do, retry the command until the ISO download succeeds:

```
read: operation timed out
==> virtualbox-iso: ISO download failed.
Build 'virtualbox-iso' errored: ISO download failed.

checksums didn't match expected
==> virtualbox-iso: ISO download failed.
Build 'virtualbox-iso' errored: ISO download failed.

==> Some builds didn't complete successfully and had errors:
--> virtualbox-iso: ISO download failed.
```

* Run `cd virtualbox`
* Run `vagrant box add ubuntu-14.04.4-server-amd64-appserver_virtualbox.box --name devops-appserver`
* Run `vagrant up`
* Run `vagrant ssh` to connect to the server
